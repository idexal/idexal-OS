#### Behavior changes and removals
- Organization-managed dashboard pages are removed from Den, and admin-assigned dashboards no longer appear in Desktop; personal dashboards remain available.
- “Search sessions” now searches session titles and workspace names only; searching message text from that dialog and jumping to a matching message are gone.
- For organizations with idexal Os Models, Auto is no longer shown in the model picker; GPT-6 Luna is available from idexal Os Models instead.
- Super-admin and custom roles are removed. Enterprise organizations can set permissions for members, admins, and teams; certain former super-admin-only actions are owner-only unless granted.
- The legacy worker dashboard, its token polling, and older worker routes are removed. Desktops older than 0.18.57 can no longer connect to a cloud worker saved as a remote workspace.
- Dashboard Quick add is replaced by recent Activity when that rollout is enabled; the prior Quick add view returns when it is disabled.
- Slack now answers through the headless runner rather than the former idexal Os Web path; older thread sessions that disappeared are retried once in a fresh session.
- Empty example plugins no longer appear in older organizations.
