# idexal Os on Google Cloud Run

These manifests map the idexal Os Helm workloads to Cloud Run:

- `idexal-os-den-api.yaml`: the Den API Kubernetes Deployment and Service
- `idexal-os-den-web.yaml`: the Den Web Kubernetes Deployment and Service
- `idexal-os-den-migrate.yaml`: the Helm pre-install/pre-upgrade migration Job

They are starter manifests, not a second Helm chart. Copy them to a private
deployment repository, replace every `REPLACE_*` value, and follow
`docs/gcp-cloud-run.md`. Never commit rendered manifests or secret values.

Helm's maintenance CronJobs have no manifest here. Set `DEN_MAINTENANCE_TOKEN`
on Den API and add a daily Cloud Scheduler job for the audit usage refresh, as
described under *Scheduled maintenance jobs* in
`packages/docs/self-host/deploy-to-your-cloud/overview.mdx`.

The API image now accepts a percent-encoded Cloud SQL socket in `DATABASE_URL`:

```text
mysql://idexalos:PERCENT_ENCODED_PASSWORD@localhost/idexal_os_den?socket=%2Fcloudsql%2FPROJECT_ID%3AREGION%3AINSTANCE
```

Cloud Run injects that socket when the manifest's
`run.googleapis.com/cloudsql-instances` annotation is set. The hostname is
required by URL parsing but MySQL uses `socketPath` for the actual connection.

Cloud Run also injects its reserved `PORT` environment variable from each
container's `containerPort`; do not add `PORT` to a service manifest.
